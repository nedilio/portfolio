I always lost or forgot my coffee card for my favourite coffee shop "Reset Coffee", so I decided to create a simple app to keep track of my coffee stamps. The app allows the admins to add and remove stamps, and it will notify you when you have enough stamps for a free coffee. It expanded to other users.
